# Select Dropdown (DISABLED)

I updated React Select so I could easily update other more important packages. As I don't even use this component in my implementation of this project I'm going to disable it and will look at re-adding it if someone wants it added back or if I need it later.

It is sort of styled, but there's so much more required
